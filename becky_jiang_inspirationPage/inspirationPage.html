            <div><a href="https://followtheblackrabbit.com/"><img src="img/bethcavener.png" alt="A clay sculpture of a goat is standing on a platform with no floor in frame. 
            A slackened noose is around the goat's neck. The other end of the noose is attached to a metal hook above the goat.
            The goat has its legs positioned like it is about to step off the platform."></a>
            </div>
            <div><a href="https://followtheblackrabbit.com/"><img src="img/bethcavener2.png" alt="A clay sculpture of a white deer standing on its hind legs. 
            Its front legs rest on top of an L-shaped podium. The deer has a long, lace veil tied around its neck that ends several feet away spread open on the ground. 
            Two arrows pierce the deer, one along its side and the other in its chest from the front."></a>
            </div>
            <div><a href="https://followtheblackrabbit.com/"><img src="img/bethcavener3.png" alt="A clay sculpture of a pale green goat. 
            A rope ties its legs to the underneath of its body and also loops around the goat’s neck, forcing it to look up. 
            The goat is tied to a bar in the middle of a large metal frame designed like a rotisserie spit. 
            There is a crank on the side of the device that turns the bar the goat is on."></a>

            <!--I didn't like the look of the sentences being in a long line past the pictures on the page, so there's some breaks.-->
        <p>I am inspired by Beth Cavener's sculptures.  
            I love the theme of exploring human psychology in her work through the physical medium of clay.
            There’s so much conveyed with the textures she incorporates into her pieces, 
            and the scale of her art is amazing. Her sculptures inspire me to tackle larger projects as well. </p>

        <div class="flexYu">
            <div><a href="https://www.tinayuartist.com"><img src="img/tinayu2.png"  alt="Six clay figurines with a glossy resin finish are lined up next to each other. 
            Each is a human face with animal characteristics and decorations. They are themed after half of the Chinese zodiac; in order from left to right are rat, ox, rooster, hare, pig, and monkey."></a>
            </div>
            <div><a href="https://www.tinayuartist.com"><img src="img/tinayu3.png" alt="White alpaca with light brown accents covered in light pink bows. A brown bunny sits on the llama's back."></a>

            <div><a href="https://www.tinayuartist.com"><img src="img/tinayu.png" alt="Orange cat with white accents wearing traditional Chinese hanfu."></a>

        <p>I am inspired by Tina Yu’s art. I love how detailed and intricate each piece is, and how you notice more things the longer you look.
            I also like seeing how she incorporates Chinese culture into her designs.
            Her work inspires me to think about how I can incorporate my heritage into my art.</p>

        <div class="flexGlaive">
            <!--I considered making these album images larger but they looked out of place with the size of the other art pictures set to a smaller height-->
            <div><a href="https://www.glaivemusic.com/"><img src="img/glaive.jpg" alt="Album cover for Glaive’s ‘All Dogs Go to Heaven’. 
            The singer Glaive sits in an open field of tall grass and yellow flowers with a pitbull sitting next to him."></a>
            </div>
            <div><a href="https://www.glaivemusic.com/"><img src="img/glaive2.jpeg" alt="Album cover for Glaive’s ‘I Care So Much That I Don’t Care At All’. 
            There is a white satellite dish in the background, and singer Glaive wearing black in the lower right foreground. The camera is focused on the satellite dish, leaving Glaive blurry."></a>
            </div>
            <div><a href="https://www.glaivemusic.com/"><img src="img/glaive3.jpg" alt="The album cover for Glaive’s ‘A Bit of a Mad One’. 
            It is a close-up of the upper bodies of two horses, one a light brown and the other black with white detailing."></a>

            <p>I like the music artist Glaive. I find his music to be comforting and think he’s a good storyteller.
             His work inspires me to think more critically about how to tell stories through my designs, and how to connect multiple pieces through a shared theme. I like working with his music on in the background.</p>
