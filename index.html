                    Hello, nice to virtually meet you! I'm Becky Jiang, a VisComm major from the Bay Area. ＼(＾▽＾)／ <br>
                    Some of my hobbies are drawing, embroidery, sewing, crochet... a lot of crafting stuff basically!
                    I love trying to recreate cool things I see online with my own twist (I'm running out of room for art supplies though (￣▽￣*)ゞ ). <br>
                    I've always got at least one sketchbook within arm's reach, and a dozen ongoing projects in the back of my mind. <br>
                    I've included some of my art below. These started as traditional sketches, the medium I'm most comfortable with. I'm new to digital art and trying to learn this year. 
                    I also like playing video games, mostly cozy co-op ones with my sister. 
                </p>
