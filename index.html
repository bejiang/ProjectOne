                    Hello, nice to virtually meet you! I'm Becky Jiang, a VisComm major from the Bay Area. ＼(＾▽＾)／ <br><br>
                    Some of my hobbies are drawing, embroidery, sewing, crochet... a lot of crafting stuff basically!
                    I like trying to recreate cool things I see online with my own twist (I'm running out of room for art supplies though  (￣▽￣*)ゞ ). <br> <br>
                    I've always got at least one sketchbook within arm's reach, and a dozen ongoing projects in the back of my mind at all times. Current ones I'm actively trying my best to work on are crocheting a pink gingham blanket, 
                    crocheting a mini hammock for some of my plushies, and designing some original stickers for my laptop.<br> <br> 
                    I've included some of my art below! These started as traditional sketches in pencil and pen, the medium I'm most comfortable with. I'm new to digital art and want to start learning more about it this year, especially how to paint digitally. I unfortunately very rarely get around to adding color to my traditional sketches these days. (^▽^;;)ゞ <br> <br>
                    I also like playing video games, mostly cozy co-op ones with my sister. We jump around games a lot and often start new save files (... mostly because we forget about previous ones...). Some of our favorite games to play are Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and Spiritfarer. If I'm playing along, I usually play story driven games like Hollow Knight, Hades, and visual novels.
